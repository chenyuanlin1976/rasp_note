# Newton's Three Laws of Motion

## Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)

+ Definition: **An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction** unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force.
+ Concept: Objects resist changes in their state of motion (inertia).
+ Example: A book on a table remains still, or a passenger in a car jerks forward when the car breaks suddenly.

## Newton's Second Law (Law of Acceleration)

+ Definition: **The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.**
+ Concept: To accelerate a heavier object, more force is required.
+ Example: It requires less force to push an empty shopping cart than a full one to achieve the same acceleration.

## Newton's Third Law (Law of Action-Reaction)

+ Definition: **For every action force, there is an equal in magnitude and opposite in direction reaction force.**
+ Concept: Forces always occur in pairs (action-reaction pairs). If Object A exerts a force on Object B, Object B simultaneously exerts an equal force back on Object A.
+ Example: A rocket launches by expelling gas downward (action), which pushes the rocket upward (reaction), or swimming by pushing water backward, causing the body to move forward.
