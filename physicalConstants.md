# physical constants

## Planck–Einstein relation

+ `E = hf`
+ Planck constant: h = 6.62607015e-34 J/Hz

## Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

+ Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: `delta_x * delta_px >= h-bar / 2`
+ reduced Planck constant (Dirac constant): h-bar = h / (2*pi)

## other Constants

+ light speed in vacuum: `c = 2.99792458e8` m/s
+ Gravitational Constant, `G = 6.674e-11`, unit is N*m^2 / kg^2 OR m^3 / kg / s^2

## other numbers

+ Earth_Mass = `5.97237e24`, unit: Kg
+ Earth_Radius = `6.371e6`, unit: m
+ gravitational acceleration, g = `9.80665`, unit: m / s^2
+ Astronomical Unit (au): It was conceived as the average Earth-Sun distance. It is 149,597,870,700 m
